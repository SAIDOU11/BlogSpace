1. How is a nested resource URL like /bikes/123/reviews
   different from an endpoint like /reviews?

   - Will return a array of reviews of the specific bike (id 123)
   - /reviews return an array of all reviews on the site

2. Describe a "URL Parameter" in your own words:

- Variable inside the URL that acts as a placeholder for the real value
  (Oftentimes they replace the ID of the resource)

3. What URL might you use to GET the review with an ID of 5 on the bike
   with the ID of 123?

- /bikes/123/reviews/5
